            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo
               and Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in
               the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and
               Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders.</p>
            <p>One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless
               crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was
               just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be
               a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And
               he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman,
               Incorporated.</p>
            <p>A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life without
               financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network
               of caves beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic
               scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.</p>
